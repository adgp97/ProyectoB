<p align="justify">
Extras branch contains files that I created as first attemps to do certain things
</p>

<p align="justify">
- convolution_2.c: second attempt to perform convolution operation between two signals defined inside the file.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- visualizacion.xlsx: an attempt to visualize the way a convolution with a finite number of taps should be done using a circular buffer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- Archivos: folder that contains scripts that I used to remember how to read data from .txt files.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- Matlab: folder that contains the scripts in which I defined the original signal, coefficients, and filterd signal to test the filter algorithm contained in Filter and Filter_int folders.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- Coeffs: folder that contains the first attempt to include header file generated with Matlab contaning filter coefficients and test the way floating-point data is truncated.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- Filter: folder that contains the final version of the filter algorithm, using float data.
</p>

<p align="justify">
- Filter_int: folder that contains the adapted filter algorithm to work with char- and int- type data.
